Project Overview:
Analyzed student performance using demographic and academic data to identify trends and correlations.

Data Inspection:
Inspected the dataset structure using basic commands like .head(), .info(), and .describe().

Data Cleaning:
Addressed missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and standardized categorical data.

Gender Distribution:
Visualized gender distribution, showing a higher number of female students than males.

Parental Education Impact:
Found that students with parents holding higher degrees scored better in all subjects.

Marital Status Analysis:
Analyzed parental marital status, showing minimal impact on student performance.

Ethnic Group Distribution:
Visualized student distribution across ethnic groups, with group C having the most representation.

Score Distributions:
Used box plots to explore the spread and outliers of Math scores across all students.

Correlations:
Heatmaps revealed strong correlations between parental education and student scores.

Conclusions:
Higher parental education positively influenced student scores, while other factors had less impact.
